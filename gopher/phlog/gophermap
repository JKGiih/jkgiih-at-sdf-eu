--On the Publication of the Latest Nervous Horse--
    Monday, May 29th, 2017
The tenth issue of Nervous Horse, a literary magazine I've been editing and publishing for four years now, came out some days ago, and the selection of pieces feels like the most avant-garde and least reader-friendly so far. To me this is an unequivocally good thing. I would even go as far as to say that this new issue is very close to how I initially envisoned the journal to be and how it probably would be if I wrote everything in it myself. But as each issue is made up of pieces by several authors and I have adopted the principle of publishing anything submitted, the result is always a surprise. And as pleasant a surprise as it was for me this time, I somehow got the impression that not all of the readers or contributors shared my excitement. The overall response to the publication of this long-awaited and long-delayed issue, save for a few moderately enthusiastic ejaculations, was that of indecipherable silence.

--How and Why I Serve My Gopherspace via HTTP--
    Friday, May 12th, 2017
I'm always late at discovering things. I grew up with a Commodore 64 in the early to mid '90s and didn't really know or care about the Internet at all until graphical browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were considered the norm. I suppose I didn't imagine I would have any use for it. After all I had hundreds of games on floppies and all the information I could possible ever need in old magazines and manuals. I completely missed out on BBS and Usenet and have barely ventured into IRC (yet).
