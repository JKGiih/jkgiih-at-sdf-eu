I'm always late at discovering things. I grew up with a Commodore 64 in the early to mid '90s and didn't really know or care about the Internet at all until graphical browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were considered the norm. I suppose I didn't imagine I would have any use for it. After all I had hundreds of games on floppies and all the information I could possible ever need in old magazines and manuals. I completely missed out on BBS and Usenet and have barely ventured into IRC (yet).

One area of the Internet I only recently learned about is Gopher. I believe it was my destiny to come by it at the very moment I did, and in the following pages I will relate to you why. It was a sunny April afternoon and I was spending my time watching let's play videos on my main monitor and browsing imageboards on the second one. An anon on /g/ mentioned the SDF Public Access UNIX System in a thread about text-based interfaces, and I decided to check it out. Incidentally I had been planning to start writing a personal blog for some time, and joining SDF seemed like a perfect way for me to host a simple text-based site on the cheap. Howered as I read the FAQ I also came across this Gopher thing. Pocket gophers, commonly referred to as gophers, are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae. Now I should mention that I have been exceptionally close to animals on a metaphysical level for as long as I can remember. I find myself repeatedly embodying a new animal. I started out as a wombat, and even before my life began I was really drawn towards martens. Then I turned into a horse, which I still am for the most part, but as you can see it is now a peculiar horse who also happens to inhabit a gopher hole.

So I decided to have a gopherspace. But as I didn't really know what a gopherspace is, I had to do some research and soon learned that it is not uncommon to use one for blogging. But wait! I already had a place for my blog. What else could I use my gopherspace for? I found myself in a bit of a pickle -- until in a flash of genius I came up with the idea of placing my blog texts in the gopherspace and using the "regular" webspace to serve the same texts to people who don't use gopher. Obviously I knew I would be too lazy to manually edit both versions of the site whenever I add new content, so I needed to figure out a method of translating gopher menu items into html links and mapping the structure of the gopherspace into a similarly navigable html site to be served over http.
